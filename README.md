## Static Site Built with React JS

This project is a static site built using React JS, showcasing key concepts and the structure of a React application.

## Key Concepts of React

- **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications, enabling the creation of dynamic and interactive web experiences.
- **Declarative**: Allows developers to describe what the UI should look like and let React handle the details.
- **Imperative**: Involves describing how to achieve each step, which is less common in React's approach.

## Components

Components are the core building blocks of React applications. They can be either functional or class-based. In this project, separate components were built for different parts of the site:

- **Info**: Displays a photo, name, and buttons.
- **About**: Provides information about the site or person.
- **Interests**: Lists interests or hobbies.
- **Footer**: Contains footer information.
